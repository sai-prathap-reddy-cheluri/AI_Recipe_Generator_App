### **👨‍🍳 Chef's Confidential: Whisper-Quiet Wisdom from the Culinary Crypt! 🤫**

1.  **The Brinjal Ballet:** Don't be shy with your brinjal (eggplant)! If you want it to be extra creamy and less "squeaky," give it a quick salt-and-drain before cooking. Just sprinkle, wait 15 minutes, then pat dry. It's like sending it to a spa day, but quicker, and it makes for a happier, less bitter brinjal. If you're really in a hurry, skip it – we won't tell! 🤫
2.  **Prawn Perfection Principle:** Prawns are like tiny, delicious supermodels – they don't like to be overdone! They cook super fast. As soon as they turn pink and curl into a C-shape, they're done. If they form an O, you've gone too far, and they'll be tougher than a math exam. Remove them from the pan immediately! 🍤

### **👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions: Let's Get Cooking!**

1.  **The Great Pasta Soak (or Boil!):** Fill a large pot with water, add a generous pinch of salt (make it taste like the ocean, but a nice one). Bring it to a rolling boil – like your excitement for this meal! Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until *al dente* (firm to the bite, not mushy like your last diet attempt). Drain, reserving about a cup of pasta water – it's liquid gold for your sauce! 🌊
2.  **Prawns' Grand Entrance:** While the pasta is doing its thing, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the prawns and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they turn pink and opaque. Don't overcook them, or they'll become rubbery fashion accessories! Remove them from the pan and set aside. Their cameo is over for now. 🎬
3.  **Veggie Vibe Check:** In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Toss in the chopped onion and brinjal. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and the brinjal starts to soften and get a little golden tan. If it looks sad, give it a stir and tell it it's doing great! ✨
4.  **Garlic's Golden Moment:** Add the minced garlic and red chili flakes to the pan. Sauté for another minute until fragrant. Don't let the garlic burn, or it'll be bitter like a bad breakup! 💔
5.  **Sauce Sensation:** Pour in the canned diced tomatoes and sprinkle in the dried oregano/Italian herbs. Stir everything together. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and let it cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and mingle like old friends at a reunion. If it's too thick, add a splash of that reserved pasta water – it's like a secret weapon! 🤫
6.  **The Grand Reunion:** Add the cooked spaghetti and the cooked prawns back into the pan with the sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is beautifully coated and the prawns are nestled amongst their new friends. If it's looking a bit dry, add more pasta water, one spoonful at a time, until it reaches your desired sauciness. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 🧂
7.  **Basil's Benediction:** Remove from heat. Stir in most of the fresh basil, saving a few leaves for garnish. This adds a burst of freshness that screams "I'm fancy, but also I cooked this in under 30 minutes!" 🌿

Serve immediately in warm bowls, topped with a generous blizzard of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and those reserved fresh basil leaves.
