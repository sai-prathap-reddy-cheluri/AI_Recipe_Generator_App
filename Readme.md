# 🍳 AI Recipe Generator

A fun and quirky **AI-powered recipe generator** built using **Streamlit**, leveraging **OpenAI** and **Google Gemini** models to whip up delicious, creative, and downright hilarious recipes — based on ingredients you already have!


## 🧠 Why I Built This

In the chaos of a busy life, I often find myself standing in front of the fridge, holding a half-eaten tomato, three chilies, and asking the age-old question: *"What can I possibly make with this?"*

So I thought — what if I could just tell an AI what's lying around in my kitchen and get a recipe that’s not just functional, but **funny**, **creative**, and **actually appetizing**?

That's how this project was born. It’s not just a recipe generator — it's a **culinary stand-up comedian** that reflects my love for humor, wit, and spontaneous cooking adventures. Whether you're hungry, lazy, or just looking to spice things up (literally), this app’s got your back!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recipe-generator.git
cd ai-recipe-generator
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔐 API Key Setup

To use this app, you'll need API keys for at least one of the following:
* [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
* [Google Gemini API Key](https://developers.google.com/gemini)

### Add your keys 
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key-here"
```
Important: Do not commit this file to GitHub. It contains sensitive credentials.

    ✅ The app automatically detects keys from either st.secrets or your system environment variables.

## 🧠 How It Works
* Users enter ingredients, cuisine preference, meal type, dietary restrictions, and max cooking time.
* The selected LLM (OpenAI or Gemini) processes a prompt with those details.
* The LLM responds with a humorous, structured recipe in a blog-style format.
* Streamlit renders the result beautifully with emojis and styled Markdown.

### ▶️ Running the App Locally
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the displayed URL in your browser (typically http://localhost:8501).

## 📦 Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in.
3. Click "New app" and select your repository.
4. Set the main file to `app.py`.
5. Add your secrets in the Streamlit Cloud settings.
6. Click "Deploy" and your app will be live!

### 👨‍🍳 **Chef's Confidential: Whispers from the Kitchen!** 🤫

1.  **The Chopping Catastrophe Clause:** If your veggies look like they survived a tiny tornado, don't panic! In a one-pot wonder, "rustic" is just a fancy word for "I chopped it myself." No one's grading your knife skills here, just your deliciousness! 🌪️🔪
2.  **The 'Spice of Life' Secret:** When adding spices, remember: you can always add more, but you can't take away! Unless you have a tiny spice vacuum. So, start small, taste, and then add more if your taste buds are brave enough to face the heat. Your stomach will thank you later (or curse you, depending on your bravery). 🔥👅
